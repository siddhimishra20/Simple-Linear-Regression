# Simple Linear Regression: Salary vs. Experience  

This project demonstrates **Simple Linear Regression** to predict employee salaries based on their years of experience. I created a regression model to make accurate salary predictions by modelling the relationship between these two variables.  

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Scikit-learn  

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview  
- **Goal**: Predict employee salaries based on years of experience.  
- **Dataset**: A dataset containing employee salary and experience information.  
- **Data Split**:  
  - **Training Set**: 80% of the data.  
  - **Test Set**: 20% of the data.  

## ðŸ”‘ Key Learnings  
- **Understanding Regression**: Modeled the relationship between two variables using the equation \( y = mx + c \).  
- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Imported and cleaned the dataset using **Pandas**.  
  - Split the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets.  
- **Model Training**:  
  - Built and trained the regression model using **Scikit-learn**.  
  - Utilized **NumPy** for calculations.  
- **Visualization**:  
  - Plotted the regression line and data points using **Matplotlib**.  
  - Compared model predictions against actual test data.  

## ðŸš€ Results  
- Successfully trained a model that accurately predicts salaries based on experience.  
- Highlighted the importance of splitting data to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.
